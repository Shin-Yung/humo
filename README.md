An efficient python library for solving various extended Fermi-Hubbard models. 

Currently the focus is to build a complete suite for exact diagonalization of finite Fermi-Hubbard models, and calculating transport through those systems.

## Documentation

The suite is currently rather undocumented. As a small intro consider looking at my [PhD dissertation](http://georglind.dk/phd/KimGLPedersen-PhDThesis-web-final.pdf).
